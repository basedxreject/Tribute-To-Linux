      <ul>
        <li><strong>1991</strong> - Linux was first released to the internet</li>
        <li>
          <strong>1992</strong> - The first standalone Linux installer, was announced by Peter MacDonald announces SLS</li>
        <li>
          <strong>1993</strong> - Slackware was released by Patrick Volkerding. Slackware is considered to be the first broadly successful Linux distribution and is still in use today</li>
        <li>
          <strong>1994</strong> - 
          Version 1.0 of the Linux kernel was released. It supported single-processor i386-based computer systems. Within the 3 years of its existence the kernel code base had grown to 176,250 lines of code</li>
        <li>
          <strong>1995</strong> - 
          Linux Expo, the first Linux-specific tradeshow and conference series, launches and becomes the most popular and well-attended annual Linux show for the next several years. The price for entry into the exhibit hall and a pass to the conferences was $4. After three years Red Hat takes over organization and becomes the major sponsor</li>
        <li>
          <strong>1996</strong> - Version 2.0 of the Linux Kernel was released. It was a significant improvement over the earlier versions being the first stable kernel to support multiple processors in a single system (SMP) and more processor types. Linux becomes a serious alternative for many companies. You can read an in advance review of Linux Version 2.0 that was published in August 1996 in the Linux Journal to learn more about the improvements
        </li>
        <strong>1998</strong> - The Google search engine was launched. Not only is it one of the best search engines around, but it’s based on Linux and features a Linux-specific search page</li>
      <li>
        <strong>1999</strong> - Linux and BSD users unite for “Windows Refund Day”. They visit Microsoft, hoping to return the unused Windows licenses that they were forced to acquire when they purchased a computer system bundled with the OS</li>
      <li>
        <strong>2000</strong> - The latest IDC report suggests that Linux now ranks as the “second-most-popular operating system for server computers”, with 25% of the server operating system sales in 1999. Windows NT is first with 38% and NetWare ranks third with 19%</li>
      <li>
        <strong>2001</strong> - The US National Security Agency (NSA) releases SELinux under the GPL. SELinux offers an additional layer of security checks in addition to the standard UNIX-like permissions system
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2004</strong> - Ubuntu came into life with the unusual version number 4.10, referring to its release date in October 2004 and the odd code name Warty Warthog. Ubuntu’s development is led by Canonical Ltd., a company owned by Mark Shuttleworth. While not being a major contributor to the kernel, Ubuntu plays an important part in the adoption of Linux on desktops and laptops</li>

        "Ultimately, whether an open-source OS is the correct choice for you depends on how you use your computer. If you're a programmer, you may prefer a stable, stripped-back design. If you have a spare or older PC lying around the house, a lightweight GNU/Linux distro might give it new life"
